- Use to speed up the process of ingesting camera original clips (rushes/dailies) into the pipeline.
- Allows quick viewing of a directory of clips with thumbnail and metadata display.
- Drag/drop UI interface for File Tiles
- Keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) are provided for common actions.
- Mini Preview Viewer for quick review of clips.
- Transfer Report generated during transfer.
- Metadata sidecar files generation (Resolve .csv and Avid .ale)
- Automated Proxy search/transfer/generation ([**see Proxys**](Docs/Doc-Proxys.md)).

- Metadata extraction and assignment using ffprobe and ExifTool ([**see Metadata Handling**](Docs/Doc-Metadata.md)).

NOTE: The name "Proxys" is used throughout this plugin.  Yes technically it should be "Proxies", but I just think Proxys looks better, so there it is.

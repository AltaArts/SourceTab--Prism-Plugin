# **Installation**

<br/>

    It is highly suggested to exit Prism before installation of SourceTab.

Copy the directory named "SourceTab" to a plugin directory of your choice, or a Prism2 plugin directory.

Prism's default plugin directories are: *{installation path}\Plugins\Apps* and *{installation Path}\Plugins\Custom*.

You can add the additional plugin search paths in Prism2 settings.  Go to Settings->Plugins and click the gear icon.  This opens a dialogue and you may add additional search paths at the bottom.

Once added, completly shutdown Prism (if running) and re-launch Prism.  This will copy the required files for the plugin, and create SourceTab settings.
